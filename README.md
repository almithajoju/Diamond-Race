# Diamond-Race
 Four colored diamonds move from the start line to the finish line. A click on a diamond moves it one step to the right. It takes 10 steps to win. The score board shows the current scores. When one diamond has a score of 10, the diamonds stop responding to clicks. The reset button takes the diamonds back to start.
